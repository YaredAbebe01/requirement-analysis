## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it forms the foundation for all subsequent stages, including design, development, testing, and deployment.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
1. **Clarifies Project Scope:** By gathering and analyzing requirements, teams can clearly define what the system should do, reducing ambiguity and preventing scope creep.  
2. **Improves Communication:** It ensures that stakeholders and developers have a shared understanding of the projectâ€™s goals, leading to better collaboration.  
3. **Prioritizes Features:** Requirement Analysis helps identify critical features that must be implemented first, allowing for effective resource allocation and planning.  
4. **Reduces Development Costs:** Detecting and addressing requirements early reduces the likelihood of costly changes later in the project.  
5. **Ensures Quality:** By clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements, the process helps create a system that meets user expectations in terms of functionality, performance, and usability.  

In summary, Requirement Analysis acts as a blueprint for the entire software development process, ensuring that the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and project objectives.
